                        Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, probably initially in the form of a tally stick.[8] The
                        Antikythera mechanism, dating from about the beginning of the first century BC, is generally considered
                        to be the earliest known mechanical analog computer, and the earliest known geared mechanism.[9]:279
                        Comparable geared devices did not emerge in Europe until the 16th century,[citation needed][according
                        to whom?] and it was not until 1645 that the first mechanical calculator capable of performing the
                        four basic arithmetical operations was developed.[10]:3 Electronic computers, using either relays
                        or valves, began to appear in the early 1940s. The electromechanical Zuse Z3, completed in 1941,
                        was the world's first programmable computer, and by modern standards one of the first machines that
                        could be considered a complete computing machine. Colossus, developed during the Second World War
                        to decrypt German messages was the first electronic digital computer. Although it was programmable,
                        it was not general-purpose, being designed to perform only a single task. It also lacked the ability
                        to store its program in memory; programming was carried out using plugs and switches to alter the
                        internal wiring.[11][page needed] The first recognisably modern electronic digital stored-program
                        computer was the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), which ran its first program
                        on 21 June 1948.[12] The development of transistors in the late 1940s at Bell Laboratories allowed
                        a new generation of computers to be designed with greatly reduced power consumption. The first commercially
                        available stored-program computer, the Ferranti Mark I, contained 4050 valves and had a power consumption
                        of 25 kilowatts. By comparison the first transistorised computer, developed at the University of
                        Manchester and operational by November 1953, consumed only 150 watts in its final version.[13]
