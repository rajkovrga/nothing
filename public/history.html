                        Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, probably initially in the form of a tally stick. The Antikythera
                        mechanism, dating from about the beginning of the first century BC, is generally considered to be
                        the earliest known mechanical analog computer, and the earliest known geared mechanism. Comparable
                        geared devices did not emerge in Europe until the 16th century, and it was not until 1645 that the
                        first mechanical calculator capable of performing the four basic arithmetical operations was developed.
                        Electronic computers, using either relays or valves, began to appear in the early 1940s. The electromechanical
                        Zuse Z3, completed in 1941, was the world's first programmable computer, and by modern standards
                        one of the first machines that could be considered a complete computing machine. Colossus, developed
                        during the Second World War to decrypt German messages was the first electronic digital computer.
                        Although it was programmable, it was not general-purpose, being designed to perform only a single
                        task. It also lacked the ability to store its program in memory; programming was carried out using
                        plugs and switches to alter the internal wiring.The first recognisably modern electronic digital
                        stored-program computer was the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), which ran its
                        first program on 21 June 1948. The development of transistors in the late 1940s at Bell Laboratories
                        allowed a new generation of computers to be designed with greatly reduced power consumption. The
                        first commercially available stored-program computer, the Ferranti Mark I, contained 4050 valves
                        and had a power consumption of 25 kilowatts. By comparison the first transistorised computer, developed
                        at the University of Manchester and operational by November 1953, consumed only 150 watts in its
                        final version.

                        Early electronic computers such as Colossus made use of punched tape, a long strip of paper on which data was represented
                        by a series of holes, a technology now obsolete. Electronic data storage, which is used in modern
                        computers, dates from World War II, when a form of delay line memory was developed to remove the
                        clutter from radar signals, the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line.
                        The first random-access digital storage device was the Williams tube, based on a standard cathode
                        ray tube, but the information stored in it and delay line memory was volatile in that it had
                        to be continuously refreshed, and thus was lost once power was removed. The earliest form of non-volatile
                        computer storage was the magnetic drum, invented in 1932 and used in the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's
                        first commercially available general-purpose electronic computer. IBM introduced the first hard disk
                        drive in 1956, as a component of their 305 RAMAC computer system. Most digital data today is still
                        stored magnetically on hard disks, or optically on media such as CD-ROMs. Until 2002 most information
                        was stored on analog devices, but that year digital storage capacity exceeded analog for the first
                        time. As of 2007 almost 94% of the data stored worldwide was held digitally:[21] 52% on hard disks,
                        28% on optical devices and 11% on digital magnetic tape. It has been estimated that the worldwide
                        capacity to store information on electronic devices grew from less than 3 exabytes in 1986 to 295
                        exabytes in 2007, doubling roughly every 3 years.
