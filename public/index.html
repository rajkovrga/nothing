    <p>Information technology (IT) is the application of computers to store, retrieve, transmit and manipulate data, or information,
      often in the context of a business or other enterprise. IT is considered to be a subset of information and communications
      technology (ICT). In 2012, Zuppo proposed an ICT hierarchy where each hierarchy level "contain[s] some degree of commonality
      in that they are related to technologies that facilitate the transfer of information and various types of electronically
      mediated communications"</p>

          Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, probably initially in the form of a tally stick.[8] The
          Antikythera mechanism, dating from about the beginning of the first century BC, is generally considered to be the
          earliest known mechanical analog computer, and the earliest known geared mechanism.[9]:279 Comparable geared devices
          did not emerge in Europe until the 16th century,[citation needed][according to whom?] and it was not until 1645
          that the first mechanical calculator capable of performing the four basic arithmetical operations was developed.[10]:3
          Electronic computers, using either relays or valves, began to appear in the early 1940s. The electromechanical
          Zuse Z3, completed in 1941, was the world's first programmable computer, and by modern standards one of the first
          machines that could be considered a complete computing machine. Colossus, developed during the Second World War
          to decrypt German messages was the first electronic digital computer. Although it was programmable, it was not
          general-purpose, being designed to perform only a single task. It also lacked the ability to store its program
          in memory; programming was carried out using plugs and switches to alter the internal wiring.[11][page needed]
          The first recognisably modern electronic digital stored-program computer was the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental
          Machine (SSEM), which ran its first program on 21 June 1948.[12] The development of transistors in the late 1940s
          at Bell Laboratories allowed a new generation of computers to be designed with greatly reduced power consumption.
          The first commercially available stored-program computer, the Ferranti Mark I, contained 4050 valves and had a
          power consumption of 25 kilowatts. By comparison the first transistorised computer, developed at the University
          of Manchester and operational by November 1953, consumed only 150 watts in its final version.[13]

          Early electronic computers such as Colossus made use of punched tape, a long strip of paper on which data was represented
          by a series of holes, a technology now obsolete.[14]:178 Electronic data storage, which is used in modern computers,
          dates from World War II, when a form of delay line memory was developed to remove the clutter from radar signals,
          the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line.[15]:1 The first random-access digital storage
          device was the Williams tube, based on a standard cathode ray tube,[16] but the information stored in it and delay
          line memory was volatile in that it had to be continuously refreshed, and thus was lost once power was removed.
          The earliest form of non-volatile computer storage was the magnetic drum, invented in 1932[17] and used in the
          Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available general-purpose electronic computer.[18] IBM introduced
          the first hard disk drive in 1956, as a component of their 305 RAMAC computer system.[19]:6 Most digital data today
          is still stored magnetically on hard disks, or optically on media such as CD-ROMs.[20]:4â€“5 Until 2002 most information
          was stored on analog devices, but that year digital storage capacity exceeded analog for the first time. As of
          2007 almost 94% of the data stored worldwide was held digitally:[21] 52% on hard disks, 28% on optical devices
          and 11% on digital magnetic tape. It has been estimated that the worldwide capacity to store information on electronic
          devices grew from less than 3 exabytes in 1986 to 295 exabytes in 2007,[22] doubling roughly every 3 years.[23]
